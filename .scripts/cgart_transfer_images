#CG Art Transfer Images
#by Garrett George

#This is a Bash script that watches a source folder (Creative\ Cloud/cgart/) for certain JPEG files and copies them into a destination folder (christina-george-art/assets/images/)
#Used for maintaining and updating the scanned portfolio images for Christie's art website

#Expected workflow:
# 1. Christie scans, edits, and merges a painting, renaming the final JPEG with '-final' in the filename
# 2. This script detects that a new matching file has been added to the source folder
# 3. The new file is copied into the destination folder, ready to be added to a new portfolio page
# 4. (Future feature) A new portfolio page is automatically created for the new image

#BEGIN SCRIPT

#Watch the folder for a RegEx matching .jpg files including the word 'final'

#Check to see if the image file already exists in the destination directory

#If so, do nothing

#If not, then copy the file to the destination directory
